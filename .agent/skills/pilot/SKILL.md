## 1. Engine Mission (INTERFACE)
The mission of the **Pilot** is to provide a high-confidence, sovereign interface for vehicle forensics virtualization. It serves as the "Sovereign Glass" through which the cognitive engines (Themis, SEVE) materialize complex data into actionable truth.

## 2. Core Technical Domain
- **Visualization**: Next.js 14+, Framer Motion for high-rigor animations.
- **Geospatial**: Leaflet-based Digital Twin integration for Living Labs (SSA, FSA, LDF).
- **Security**: Stealth Authentication Gate (Middleware) + IP Lockdown protocols.
- **Telemetry**: Real-time IMU/G-Force noise modeling and forensic validation.

## 3. Key Directives (Engineering Stealth)
- **Institutional Authority**: Always maintain a mature, engineering-driven tone. Avoid "salesy" or "evaluator-focused" language.
- **Anonymization Protocol**: Refer to proprietary algorithms as "L1 Core Protocol" or "Hardware Secure Element Logic" to protect IP during the prototype phase.
- **Themis Alignment**: Every UI component must be defensible under Themis L3 juridical rules.
- **Visual Excellence**: Dark-mode high-density interfaces only. No "generic AI-style" placeholders.

## 4. Interaction Protocol
- **Onboarding**: Strategic tutorship focused on functional necessity and technical "Why".
- **Documentation**: Access-controlled technical assets (Protocol Papers, Specs).
- **Telemetry**: High-precision data loops with cryptographic signatures.
