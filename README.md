# 🚔 GuardDrive: Inviolable Vehicle Forensics

> **Sovereign Infrastructure for Urban Security & Smart City Governance**

## 👁️ The Vision
**GuardDrive** is a biocybernetic innovation project designed to transform standard vehicle telemetry into an absolute, cryptographically signed stream of forensic evidence. 

By merging **IoT Edge Computing** with **Hybrid Blockchain Architecture**, GuardDrive creates an immutable "Digital Witness" for every vehicle, ensuring transparency for drivers, truth for authorities, and high-fidelity data for insurers.

## ⚡ Core Pillars (Trinity Protocol)

### 1. Forensic Telemetry (OPPORTUNITY)
Real-time tracking of speed, G-force, and inertial patterns. Unlike standard trackers, GuardDrive detects impact vectors and collision angles with scientific precision.

### 2. IP Lockdown (VALIDATION)
All telemetry data is signed locally via a **Secure Element (STM32)** before transmission. This ensures that the data remains sovereign and untamperable even if the communication network is compromised.

### 3. Smart City Infrastructure (AUTHORITY)
Featuring a dynamic **E-ink QR Display** and **Infrared Status LEDs**, GuardDrive allows traffic authorities and smart city towers to scan a vehicle's "Identity NFT" and insurance status in real-time, 24/7.
