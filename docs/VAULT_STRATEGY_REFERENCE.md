## 🧩 The "Grant Agnostic" Philosophy

To ensure we are ready for *any* edital:

### 1. The Chameleon Narrative
We do not rewrite; we **recompile**.
- **For Gov Grants**: Emphasize *Sovereignty, ESG, Smart Cities*.
- **For VCs**: Emphasize *SaaS Metrics, Hardware Moat, Exit Strategy*.
- **For Technical Audits**: Emphasize *ZK-Proofs, Codes, TRL*.

### 2. The "Evidence Bank"
Keep a folder of "Proof Assets" ready to deploy:
- Lab Reports (Salvador Living Lab)
- GitHub Commit Histories (Activity Proof)
- Patent Deposit Receipts
- Letters of Intent (LOIs) from Partners

### 3. Rapid Deployment Protocol
When a new edital opens:
1.  **Clone** an Adapter folder (e.g., `02_GRANT_ADAPTERS/NEW_EDITAL`).
2.  **Symlink** the relevant Core IP modules.
3.  **Refine** the "Look & Feel" using the Brand System.
4.  **Submit**.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Assets (Do Not Share Publicly)

The following must **NEVER** leave this vault except in encrypted submissions:
1.  **The "Black Box" Algo**: The specific weightings of the Driver Scoring algorithm.
2.  **Hardware Schematics (L1)**: Physical PCB designs and HSM integration.
3.  **Investor Cap Table**: Detailed equity splits.

> **Status**: This methodology transforms GuardDrive from a "project seeking funding" into a **"Funding-Ready Institution"**.
